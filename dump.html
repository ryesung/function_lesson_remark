A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both! We call functions that get passed in as parameters callback functions. Callback functions get invoked during the execution of the higher-order function.

When we invoke a higher-order function, and pass another function in as an argument, we dont invoke the argument function. Invoking it would evaluate to passing in the return value of that function call. With callback functions, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name without the parentheses:
